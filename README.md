# UniPal

Our application, UniPal, provides a textbook-focused platform for San Jose State University students to purchase and sell books conveniently. UniPal is aimed at making it easy to trade used textbooks; the app can relieve students of the burden of buying new textbooks, which are skyrocketing in price. Students can also bypass intermediaries and trade directly with each other depending on the course they are taking. This allows us to keep our brokerage fees low compared to other textbook sales platforms.
